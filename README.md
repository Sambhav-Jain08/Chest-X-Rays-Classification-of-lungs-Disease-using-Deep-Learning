Despite technological advancements, clinicians still need to comprehend and correctly assess a patient's health state from an X-ray image. In this experiment, it is determined whether the patient is healthy, has Covid19, pneumonia, or tuberculosis using a vast collection of X-ray scans. Despite the fact that there is still much to be done, this will be very useful in the disciplines of machine learning and medical science.

A Keras model has been created for classifying the X-ray images. And model returns a handsome result with an accuracy rating og 80%.
